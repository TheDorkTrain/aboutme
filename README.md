# Bryce's Portfolio

## Description

This portfolio serves as a potential hub for those who are interested in my projects. It shows my coding and writing projects as well as provides some public information about me.
It makes forwarding coding projects easier to future employers and helps me showcase my work. Throughout making it, I learned a bit of web design as well from hands on practice. (something that I hope to develop more)

## Usage

There are three sections on this page, the main page which has info about me, and a projects and writings page. You can navigate between the sections using the navigational tabs pictured below:

## Credits

Shoutout to Max Bonetti who encouraged me to post the website and stop nitpicking design choices. (further improvements can come later)

## Upcoming Features

Right now the features are a little limited by my current knowledge, however I plan to add a comment page where people can leave comments on various projects or suggest a new one.

## How to Contribute

If we have a project we have worked on together and would like to see me showcase it, let me know and I will be happy to add it.
